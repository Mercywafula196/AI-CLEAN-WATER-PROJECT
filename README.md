# 💧 AI for Clean Water (SDG 6)

An AI-powered solution that predicts **water potability** (safe vs unsafe) using machine learning, supporting **UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 — Clean Water and Sanitation**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a **Random Forest Classification model** that predicts if water is safe to drink based on measurable chemical properties such as pH, hardness, solids, and chloramines.  

It demonstrates how **AI and Software Engineering principles** (automation, testing, modular design, and ethical AI) can help achieve global sustainability goals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Support **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation** by providing accessible AI tools.
- Apply **Software Engineering practices** (testing, version control, CI/CD).
- Demonstrate **ethical and sustainable AI development**.
